						often written in the first person. The stories are designed to be immersive and unsettling, creating a chilling atmosphere 
						for the readers.</p>

						Writers can share their stories on various genres, and the platform has launched some stories into mainstream media adaptations.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="body">While Wattpad has a large and active community, most stories are hit or miss, as is common with indie works. 
						Some of the stories can be incredibly well-written, while others may not meet everyone's tastes. This is part of the charm of being an open platform where anyone can publish their work. 
						Itâ€™s also a space where young writers can experiment and grow.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="body"><i>Developer's note: Personally, I don't use Wattpad, as I prefer other platforms. However, it's undeniable that it has created a significant impact in the digital storytelling world, 
						especially for readers and writers in the Philippines. Each to their own, I guess.</i></p>
